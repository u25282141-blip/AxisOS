## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues, discussions, or social media.** Public disclosure before a fix is available puts users and installations at risk.

### Preferred Method: Private Vulnerability Reporting (GitHub)
AxisOS has **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** enabled:
1. Navigate to the [AxisOS Security Advisories](https://github.com/u25282141-blip/AxisOS/security/advisories) page.
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Fill out the advisory form with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Affected components (e.g. `axisos-daemon`, `axis-update`, `shell/`, kernel driver).
   - Step-by-step instructions or Proof of Concept (PoC) to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact (e.g. privilege escalation, denial of service, remote code execution).
4. Submit the report. This creates a confidential, private advisory visible only to maintainers.

### Alternative Method: Direct Security Contact
If you cannot use GitHub's advisory system, send an encrypted or private email directly to:
- **Lead Maintainer**: Jacky Mpoka (`jackympoka22@gmail.com`)
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] AxisOS Vulnerability Report: <Brief Summary>`

## ⏱️ Response & Disclosure Timeline

We adhere to coordinated vulnerability disclosure best practices:

1. **Initial Acknowledgment**: Within **48 hours** of receiving your report, a maintainer will acknowledge receipt and begin triage.
2. **Assessment & Confirmation**: Within **5 business days**, we will confirm reproduction and severity rating (CVSS score).
3. **Patch Development & Validation**: A fix will be developed in a private security fork or branch.
4. **Coordinated Release**: Once verified, the patch will be merged, and an updated package or ISO release will be published alongside an official CVE/GHSA advisory giving proper credit to the reporter.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices for AxisOS Components

- **Desktop Shell**: Runs with sandboxed Web APIs communicating strictly via authenticated/local endpoints.
- **System Daemon (`axisos-daemon`)**: Listens strictly on `127.0.0.1:3000` to prevent unauthorized external network exposure.
- **Atomic Updates (`axis update`)**: Utilizes dual-partition A/B staging to prevent persistent unbootable bricking states.
- **Packaging (`axis`)**: Package archives are checked for filesystem containment before extraction.

Thank you for helping us keep AxisOS secure for everyone! 🌟
